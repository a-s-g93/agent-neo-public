# Agent-Neo

Agent Neo has three main purposes 
- To help colleagues use the Neo4j Graph Data Science library more effectively
- To develop best practices for grounding an LLM in a knowledge graph
- To use the knowledge graph and graph data science algorithms to analyze performance.

Agent Neo allows users to alter different aspects of LLM behavior with all parameters and messages being logged in a Neo4j graph database for analysis. Agent Neo is grounded in Graph Data Science.
